# Python-challenge

this is where I will put together my project report

PyBank
Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

The total number of months included in the dataset

The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes

The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

The total number of votes cast

A complete list of candidates who received votes

The percentage of votes each candidate won

The total number of votes each candidate won

The winner of the election based on popular vote.

In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

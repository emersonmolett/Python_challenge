This is the first assignment using Python! The homework is broken into two (2) parts. PyBank analyzes financial information. PyPoll reviews election data.  For both sections, CSVs are read in and headers displayed. <br>

For PyBank the code is written to display:
<li>Total months</li>
<li>Total</li>
<li>Average change</li>
<li>Greatest increase</li>
<li>Greatest decrease</li>

<br>
For PyPoll the code is written to display:
<li>Total votes</li>
<li>Each candidates’ total votes</li>
<li>Each candidates’ percent of votes</li>
<li>Winner </li>

<br>
The results for PyBank and PyPoll were both exported to text files. In both instances, code was run error free.
